title: 'Removing Effect Dependencies'
---

<Intro>

When you write an Effect, the linter will verify that you've included every reactive value (like props and state) that the Effect reads in the list of your Effect's dependencies. This ensures that your Effect remains synchronized with the latest props and state of your component. Unnecessary dependencies may cause your Effect to run too often, or even create an infinite loop. Follow this guide to review and remove unnecessary dependencies from your Effects.

## Dependencies should match the code {/*dependencies-should-match-the-code*/}

When you write an Effect, you first specify how to [start and stop](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#the-lifecycle-of-an-effect) whatever you want your Effect to be doing:

```js {5-7}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  	// ...
}
```

Then, if you leave the Effect dependencies empty (`[]`), and the linter will suggest the correct dependencies:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []); // <-- Fix the mistake here!
  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;
}

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js chat.js
export function createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('‚úÖ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('‚ùå Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

```css
input { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
button { margin-left: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

Fill them in according to what the linter says:

```js {6}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ‚úÖ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

[Effects "react" to reactive values.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#effects-react-to-reactive-values) Since `roomId` is a reactive value (it can change due to a re-render), the linter verifies that you've specified it as a dependency. If `roomId` receives a different value, React will re-synchronize your Effect. This ensures that the chat stays connected to the selected room and "reacts" to the dropdown:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]);
  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;
}

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js chat.js
export function createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('‚úÖ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('‚ùå Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

```css
input { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
button { margin-left: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

### To remove a dependency, prove that it's not a dependency {/*to-remove-a-dependency-prove-that-its-not-a-dependency*/}

Notice that you can't "choose" the dependencies of your Effect. Every <CodeStep step={2}>reactive value</CodeStep> used by your Effect's code must be declared in your dependency list. Your Effect's dependency list is determined by the surrounding code:

```js [[2, 3, "roomId"], [2, 5, "roomId"], [2, 8, "roomId"]]
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // This is a reactive value
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // This Effect reads that reactive value
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ‚úÖ So you must specify that reactive value as a dependency of your Effect
  // ...
}
```

[Reactive values](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#all-variables-declared-in-the-component-body-are-reactive) include props and all variables and functions declared directly inside of your component. Since `roomId` is a reactive value, you can't remove it from the dependency list. The linter wouldn't allow it:

```js {8}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []); // üî¥ React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'url'
  // ...
}
```

And the linter would be right! Since `roomId` may change over time, this would introduce a bug in your code.

**To remove a dependency, you need to "prove" to the linter that it *doesn't need* to be a dependency.** For example, you can move `roomId` out of your component to prove that it's not reactive and won't change on re-renders:

```js {2,9}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';
const roomId = 'music'; // Not a reactive value anymore

function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []); // ‚úÖ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

Now that `roomId` is not a reactive value (and can't change on a re-render), it doesn't need to be a dependency:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';
const roomId = 'music';

export default function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []);
  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;
}
```

```js chat.js
export function createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('‚úÖ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('‚ùå Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

```css
input { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
button { margin-left: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

This is why you could now specify an [empty (`[]`) dependency list.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#what-an-effect-with-empty-dependencies-means) Your Effect *really doesn't* depend on any reactive value anymore, so it *really doesn't* need to re-run when any of the component's props or state change.

### To change the dependencies, change the code {/*to-change-the-dependencies-change-the-code*/}

You might have noticed a pattern in your workflow:

1. First, you **change the code** of your Effect or how your reactive values are declared.
2. Then, you follow the linter and adjust the dependencies to **match the code you have changed.**
3. If you're not happy with the list of dependencies, you **go back to the first step** (and change the code again).

The last part is important. **If you want to change the dependencies, change the surrounding code first.** You can think of the dependency list as [a list of all the reactive values used by your Effect's code.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#react-verifies-that-you-specified-every-reactive-value-as-a-dependency) You don't intentionally *choose* what to put on that list. The list *describes* your code. To change the dependency list, change the code.

This might feel like solving an equation. You might start with a goal (for example, to remove a dependency), and you need to "find" the exact code matching that goal. Not everyone finds solving equations fun, and the same thing could be said about writing Effects! Luckily, there is a list of common recipes that you can try below.

<Gotcha>

If you have an existing codebase, you might have some Effects that suppress the linter like this:

```js {3-4}
useEffect(() => {
  // ...
  // üî¥ Avoid suppressing the linter like this:
  // eslint-ignore-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-dependencies
}, []);
```

**When dependencies don't match the code, there is a very high risk of introducing bugs.** By suppressing the linter, you "lie" to React about the values your Effect depends on. Instead, use the techniques below.

</Gotcha>

<DeepDive title="Why is suppressing the dependency linter so dangerous?">

Suppressing the linter leads to very unintuitive bugs that are hard to find and fix. Here's one example:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [increment, setIncrement] = useState(1);

  function onTick() {
	setCount(count + increment);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(onTick, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>
        Counter: {count}
        <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
      </h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Every second, increment by:
        <button disabled={increment === 0} onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i - 1);
        }}>‚Äì</button>
        <b>{increment}</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i + 1);
        }}>+</button>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

The author of this code wanted to run the Effect "only on mount." They've read that empty (`[]`) dependencies correspond to that, and so they've decided to ignore the linter, and to forcefully specify `[]` as the dependencies of this Effect. However, the Effect does not work as they intended.

This counter is supposed to increment every second by the amount configurable with the two buttons.

However, since you "lied" to React that this Effect doesn't depend on anything, React forever keeps using the `onTick` function from the initial render. [During that render,](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot#rendering-takes-a-snapshot-in-time) `count` was `0` and `increment` was `1`. This is why `onTick` from that render always calls `setCount(0 + 1)` every second, and you always see `1`. Bugs like this get much harder to find and fix when they're spread across multiple components.

**We recommend to treat the dependency lint error as a compilation error. If you don't suppress it, you will never see bugs like this.** The rest of this page documents the alternatives for this and other cases.

</DeepDive>

## Removing unnecesary dependencies {/*removing-unnecesary-dependencies*/}

Every time you adjust the Effect's dependencies to reflect the code, look at the dependency list. Does it make sense for the Effect to re-run when any of these dependencies change? Sometimes, the answer is "no":

* Sometimes, you want to re-execute *different parts* of your Effect under different conditions.
* Sometimes, you want to only read the *latest value* of some dependency instead of "reacting" to its changes.
* Sometimes, a dependency may change too often *unintentionally* because it's an object or a function.

To find the right solution, you'll need to answer a few questions about your Effect. Let's walk through them.

### Should this code move to an event handler? {/*should-this-code-move-to-an-event-handler*/}

The first thing you should think about is whether this code should be an Effect at all. For example, suppose you have a form thats submits a POST request and shows a notification. You trigger the Effect by setting state:

```js {4-10}
function Form() {
  const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (submitted) {
      // üî¥ Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect
      post('/api/register');
      showNotification('Successfully registered!');
    }
  }, [submitted]); // ‚úÖ All dependencies declared

  function handleSubmit() {
    setSubmitted(true);
  }  

  // ...
}
```

Later, you want to style the notification message according to the current theme, so you read the current theme. Since `theme` is declared in the component body, it is a reactive value, and you must declare it as a depedency:

```js {3,9,11}
function Form() {
  const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (submitted) {
      // üî¥ Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect
      post('/api/register');
      showNotification('Successfully registered!', theme);
    }
  }, [submitted, theme]); // ‚úÖ All dependencies declared

  function handleSubmit() {
    setSubmitted(true);
  }  

  // ...
}
```

But by doing this, you've introduced a bug. Imagine you submit the form first and then switch between Dark and Light themes. The `theme` will change, the Effect will re-run, and so it will display the same notification again!

**The problem here is that this shouldn't be an Effect in the first place.** You want to send this POST request and show the notification in response to *submitting the form,* which is a particular interaction. When you want to run some code in response to particular interaction, put that logic directly into the corresponding event handler:

```js {6-7}
function Form() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  function handleSubmit() {
    // ‚úÖ Good: Event-specific logic is called from event handlers
    post('/api/register');
    showNotification('Successfully registered!', theme);
  }  

  // ...
}
```

Now that the code is in an event handler, it's not reactive--so it will only run when the user submits the form. Read more about [choosing between event handlers and Effects](/learn/separating-events-from-effects#reactive-values-and-reactive-logic) and [how to delete unnecessary Effects.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)

### Is your Effect doing several unrelated things? {/*is-your-effect-doing-several-unrelated-things*/}

The next question you should ask yourself is whether your Effect is trying to do too much.

Imagine you're creating a shipping form where the user needs to choose their city and area. You fetch the list of `cities` from the server according to the selected `country` so that you can show them as dropdown options:

```js
function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);
  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => {
        if (!ignore) {
          setCities(json);
        }
      });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [country]); // ‚úÖ All dependencies declared

  // ...
```

This is a good example of [fetching data in an Effect.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect#fetching-data) You are synchronizing the `cities` state with the network according to the `country` prop. You can't do this in an event handler because you need to fetch as soon as `ShippingForm` is displayed and whenever the `country` changes (no matter which interaction causes it).

Now let's say you're adding a second select box for city areas, which should fetch the `areas` for the currently selected `city`. You might start by adding a second `fetch` call for the list of areas inside the same Effect:

```js {15-24,28}
function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);
  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);
  const [areas, setAreas] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => {
        if (!ignore) {
          setCities(json);
        }
      });
    // üî¥ Avoid: A single Effect synchronizes two independent processes
    if (city) {
      fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(json => {
          if (!ignore) {
            setAreas(json);
          }
        });
    }
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [country, city]); // ‚úÖ All dependencies declared

  // ...
```

However, since the Effect now uses the `city` state variable, you've had to add `city` to the list of dependencies. That, in turn, has introduced a problem. Now, whenever the user selects a different city, the Effect will re-run and call `fetchCities(country)`. As a result, you will be unnecessarily refetching the list of cities many times.

**The problem with this code is that you're synchronizing two different unrelated things:**

1. You want to synchronize the `cities` state to the network based on the `country` prop.
1. You want to synchronize the `areas` state to the network based on the `city` state.

Split the logic into two Effects, each of which reacts to the prop that it needs to synchronize with:

```js {19-33}
function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => {
        if (!ignore) {
          setCities(json);
        }
      });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [country]); // ‚úÖ All dependencies declared

  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);
  const [areas, setAreas] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (city) {
      let ignore = false;
      fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(json => {
          if (!ignore) {
            setAreas(json);
          }
        });
      return () => {
        ignore = true;
      };
    }
  }, [city]); // ‚úÖ All dependencies declared

  // ...
```

Now the first Effect only re-runs if the `country` changes, while the second Effect re-runs when the `city` changes. You've separated them by purpose: two separate Effects synchronize two different things.

The final code is longer than the original, but splitting these Effects is still correct. **Each Effect should represent an independent synchronization process.** [If there is one thing being synchronized, there should be one Effect.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#each-effect-represents-a-separate-synchronization-process) If there are two different things being synchronized independently from each other, then there should be two Effects. You should split Effects according to their purpose, not whether the code is shorter or "feels cleaner."

In the above example, deleting one Effect wouldn't break the other Effect's logic. This is a good indication that they synchronize different things, and so it made sense to split them up. On the other hand, if you can't delete one Effect without breaking the other, it's usually a sign that [your Effects are unnecessarily granular and fragile.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect#chains-of-computations)

<DeepDive title="Extracting repetitive code into a custom Hook">

After you split up Effects so that each Effect is independent, the next logical step is often to wrap the Effect into a custom Hook. This will make your components more readable and express your intent more clearly. In the above example, the two Effects are independent but share a lot of repetitive code. You can simplify the `ShippingForm` component above by extracting the Effect into your own `useData` Hook:

```js {1}
function useData(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (url) {
      let ignore = false;
      fetch(url)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(json => {
          if (!ignore) {
            setData(json);
          }
        });
      return () => {
        ignore = true;
      };
    }
  }, [url]); // ‚úÖ All dependencies declared
  return data;
}
```

Now you can replace both Effects in the `ShippingForm` components with calls to `useData`:

```js {2,4}
function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const cities = useData(`/api/cities?country=${country}`);
  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);
  const areas = useData(city ? `/api/areas?city=${city}` : null);
  // ...
```

When your Effect was doing multiple unrelated things, it was hard to tell how the data flowed in and out. After you've split it in two, the data flow became easier to follow. Extracting a custom Hook makes the data flow even more explicit: you feed the `url` in and you get the `data` out. By "hiding" your Effect inside `useData`, you also prevent someone working on the `ShippingForm` component from adding unnecessary dependencies to it. Ideally, with time, most of your app's Effects will be in custom Hooks.

</DeepDive>

<DeepDive title="When is extracting a custom Hook a good idea?">

Start by choosing your custom Hook's name. If you struggle to pick a clear name, it might mean that your Effect is too coupled to the rest of your component's logic, and is not yet ready to be extracted.

Ideally, your custom Hook's name should be clear enough that even a person who doesn't write code often could have a good guess about what your custom Hook does, what it takes, and what it returns:

* ‚úÖ `useData(url)`
* ‚úÖ `useImpressionLog(eventName, extraData)`
* ‚úÖ `useChatConnection(roomId)`

When you synchronize with an external system, your custom Hook name may be more technical and use jargon specific to that system. It's good as long as it would be clear to a person familiar with that system:

* ‚úÖ `useMediaQuery(query)`
* ‚úÖ `useSocket(url)`
* ‚úÖ `useIntersectionObserver(ref, options)`

**Keep custom Hooks focused on concrete high-level use cases.** Avoid creating and using custom "lifecycle" Hooks that act as alternatives and convenience wrappers for the `useEffect` API itself:

* üî¥ `useMount(fn)`
* üî¥ `useEffectOnce(fn)`
* üî¥ `useUpdateEffect(fn)`

For example, this `useMount` Hook tries to ensure some code only runs "on mount":

```js {2-3,12-13}
function ChatRoom() {
  // üî¥ Avoid: using custom "lifecycle" Hooks
  useMount(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();

    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_chat' });
  });
  // ...
}

// üî¥ Avoid: creating custom "lifecycle" Hooks
function useMount(fn) {
  useEffect(() => {
    fn();
  }, []); // üî¥ React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'fn'
}
```

**Custom "lifecycle" Hooks like `useMount` don't fit well into the React paradigm.** For example, if you used this `useMount` Hook instead of a raw `useEffect` in the earlier [chat room example](#dependencies-should-match-the-code), the linter wouldn't find the mistake in your code when you forgot to "react" to `roomId` changes.

If you're writing an Effect, start by using the React API directly:

```js
// ‚úÖ Good: raw Effects separated by purpose
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]);

  useEffect(() => {
    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_chat', roomId });
  }, [roomId]);

  // ...
}
```

Then, you can (but don't have to) extract custom Hooks for different high-level use cases:

```js
// ‚úÖ Great: custom Hooks named after their purpose
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useChatConnection(roomId);
  useImpressionLog('visit_chat', { roomId });
  // ...
}
```

**A good custom Hook makes the calling code more declarative by constraining what it does.** For example, `useChatConnection(roomId)` can only connect to the chat room, while `useImpressionLog(eventName, extraData)` can only send an impression log to the analytics. If your custom Hook API doesn't constrain the use cases and is very abstract, in the long run it's likely to introduce more problems than it solves.

</DeepDive>

### Are you reading some state to calculate the next state? {/*are-you-reading-some-state-to-calculate-the-next-state*/}

This Effect updates the `messages` state variable with a newly created array every time a new message arrives:

```js {2,6-8}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      setMessages([...messages, receivedMessage]);
    });

It uses the `messages` variable to [create a new array](/learn/updating-arrays-in-state) starting with all the existing messages and adds the new message at the end. However, since `messages` is a reactive value read by an Effect, it must be a dependency:

```js {7,10}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      setMessages([...messages, receivedMessage]);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, messages]); // ‚úÖ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

And making `messages` a dependency introduces a problem.

Every time you receive a message, `setMessages()` causes the component to re-render with a new `messages` array that includes the received message. However, since this Effect now depends on `messages`, this will *also* re-synchronize the Effect. So every new message will make the chat re-connect. The user would not like that!

To fix the issue, don't read `messages` inside the Effect. Instead, pass an [updater function](/apis/react/useState#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state) to `setMessages`:

```js {7,10}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (receivedMessage) => {
      setMessages(msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ‚úÖ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

**Notice how your Effect does not read the `messages` variable at all now.** You only need to pass an updater function like `msgs => [...msgs, receivedMessage]`. React [puts your updater function in a queue](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) and will provide the `msgs` argument to it during the next render. This is why the Effect itself doesn't need to depend on `messages` anymore. As a result of this fix, receiving a chat message will no longer make the chat re-connect.
