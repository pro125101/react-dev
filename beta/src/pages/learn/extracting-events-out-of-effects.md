title: 'Extracting Events out of Effects'
---

<Intro>

When your Effect's code reads a prop or another reactive value, you must add it to the Effect's dependencies. This ensures that if the component re-renders with a changed value, your Effect will re-synchronize. For example, if your Effect connects to a chat server, it makes sense for it to re-connect every time the user picks a different server. However, sometimes you'll need to read a value from your Effect's code without "reacting" to its changes. You can't do it from inside the Effect, but you can extract an *Event function* out of your Effect's code, and read the value there.

## Choosing between event handlers and Effects {/*choosing-between-event-handlers-and-effects*/}

Imagine you're implementing a chat room component. Your requirements look like this:

1. Your component should automatically connect to the selected chat room.
1. When you click the "Send" button, it should send a message to the chat.

Let's say you've already implemented the code for them, but you're not sure where to put it. Should you use event handlers or Effects? Every time you need to answer this question, consider [*why* the code needs to run.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#what-are-effects-and-how-are-they-different-from-events)

### Event handlers run in response to specific interactions {/*event-handlers-run-in-response-to-specific-interactions*/}

From the user's perspective, sending a message should happen *because* the particular "Send" button was clicked. The user will get rather upset if you send their message at any other time or for any other reason. This is why sending a message should be an event handler. Event handlers let you handle specific interactions like clicks:

```js {4-6}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
  // ...
  function handleSendClick() {
    sendMessage(message);
  }
  // ...
  return (
    <>
      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleSendClick}>Send</button>;
    </>
  );
}
```

With an event handler, you can be sure that `sendMessage(message)` will *only* run if the user presses the button.

### Effects run whenever synchronization is needed {/*effects-run-whenever-synchronization-is-needed*/}

Recall that you also need to keep the component connected to the chat room. Where does that code go?

The *reason* to run this code is not some particular interaction. It doesn't matter why or how the user navigated to the chat room screen. Now that they're looking at it and could interact with it, the component needs to stay connected to the selected chat server. Even if the chat room component was the initial screen of your app, and the user has not performed any interactions at all, you would *still* need to connect. This is why it's an Effect:

```js {3-9}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

With this code, you can be sure that there is always an active connection to the currently selected chat server, *regardless* of the specific interactions performed by the user. Whether the user has only opened your app, selected a different room, or navigated to another screen and back, your Effect will ensure that the component will *remain synchronized* with the currently selected room, and will [re-connect whenever it's necessary.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#why-synchronization-may-need-to-happen-more-than-once)

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection, sendMessage } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]);

  function handleSendClick() {
    sendMessage(message);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleSendClick}>Send</button>
    </>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>
        {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}
      </button>
      {show && <hr />}
      {show && <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />}
    </>
  );
}
```

```js chat.js
export function sendMessage(message) {
  console.log('üîµ You sent: ' + message);
}

export function createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('‚úÖ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('‚ùå Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

```css
input, select { margin-right: 20px; }
```

## Reactive values and reactive logic {/*reactive-values-and-reactive-logic*/}

Intuitively, you could say that event handlers are always triggered "manually," for example by clicking a button. Effects, on the other hand, are "automatic": they run and re-run as often as it's needed to stay synchronized.

There is a more precise way to think about this.

Props, state, and variables declared inside your component's body are called <CodeStep step={2}>reactive values</CodeStep>. In this example, `serverUrl` is not a reactive value, but `roomId` and `message` are. They participate in the rendering data flow:

```js [[2, 3, "roomId"], [2, 4, "message"]]
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  // ...
}
```

Reactive values like these can change due to a re-render. For example, the user may edit the `message` or choose a different `roomId` in a dropdown. Event handlers and Effects are different in how they respond to changes:

- **Logic inside event handlers is *not reactive.*** It will not run again unless the user performs the same interaction (for example, a click) again. Event handlers can read reactive values, but they don't "react" to their changes.
- **Logic inside Effects is *reactive.*** If your Effect reads a reactive value, [you have to specify it as a dependency](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#effects-react-to-reactive-values). Then, if a re-render causes that value to change, React will re-run your Effect's logic again with the new value.

Let's revisit the previous example to illustrate this difference.

### Logic inside event handlers is not reactive {/*logic-inside-event-handlers-is-not-reactive*/}

Take a look at this line of code. Should this logic be reactive or not?

```js [[2, 2, "message"]]
    // ...
    sendMessage(message);
    // ...
```

From the user's perspective, **a change to the `message` does _not_ mean that they want to send a message.** It only means that the user is typing. In other words, the logic that sends a message should not be reactive. It should not run again only because the <CodeStep step={2}>reactive value</CodeStep> has changed. That's why you placed this logic in the event handler:

```js {2}
  function handleSendClick() {
    sendMessage(message);
  }
```

Event handlers aren't reactive, so `sendMessage(message)` will only run when the user clicks the Send button.

### Logic inside Effects is reactive {/*logic-inside-effects-is-reactive*/}

Now let's return to these lines:

```js [[2, 2, "roomId"]]
    // ...
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    // ...
```

From the user's prespective, **a change to the `roomId` *does* mean that they want to connect to a different room.** In other words, the logic for connecting to the room should be reactive. You *want* these lines of code to "keep up" with the <CodeStep step={2}>reactive value</CodeStep>, and to run again if that value is different. That's why you put this logic inside an Effect:

```js {2-3}
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect()
    };
  }, [roomId]);
```

Effects are reactive, so `createConnection(serverUrl, roomId)` and `connection.connect()` will run for every distinct value of `roomId`. Your Effect keeps the chat connection synchronized to the currently selected room.
