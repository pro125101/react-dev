<Intro>

## Reference {/*reference*/}

### `render(reactNode, container)` {/*render*/}

Call `render` to display a React component inside a `container` browser DOM element.

```js
const container = document.getElementById('root');
render(<App />, container);
```

React will take over managing the DOM inside of the `container`.

An app fully built with React will usually only have one `render` call with its root component.  A page that uses "sprinkles" of React for parts of the page may have as many `render` calls as needed. [See examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters {/*parameters*/}

* `reactNode`: A *React node* that you want to display. This will usually be a piece of JSX like `<App />`, but you can also pass a React elmenent constructed with [`createElement()`](/TODO), a string, a number, `null`, or `undefined`. 

* `container`: A [DOM element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element). React will change its content to the rendering output of the first argument.

#### Returns {/*returns*/}

`render` usually returns `null`. However, if the `reactNode` you pass is a *class component*, then it will return an instance of that component.

#### Caveats {/*caveats*/}

* The first time you call `render` with some `container` node, React will clear that node's existing HTML content before rendering the React component into it. If your `container` contains HTML generated by React on the server or during the build, use [`hydrate()`](/TODO) instead, which attaches the event handlers to the existing HTML.

* If you call `render` on the same `container` more than once, React will update the DOM as necessary to reflect the latest JSX you passed. React will decide which parts of the DOM can be reused and which need to be recreated by ["matching it up"](/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state) with the previously rendered tree. Calling `render` on the same `container` again is similar to calling the [`set` function](/apis/usestate#setstate) on the root component: React avoids unnecessary DOM updates.

* If your app is fully built with React, you shouldn't need to use `render` more than in a single place in your app. (You might even not use it at all if a framework does this for you.) If you want to render something in a different part of the DOM tree (for example, a modal or a tooltip), use [`createPortal`](TODO) instead.

### `render(element, container, callback)` {/*render-callback*/}

Same as [`render(element, container)`](#renderreactnode-container).

#### Parameters {/*render-callback-parameters*/}

* `element`: Same as above.
* `container`: Same as above.
* `callback`: A function. If passed, React will call it after your component is placed into the DOM.

#### Returns {/*render-callback-returns*/}

Same as above.

## Usage {/*usage*/}

### Rendering the root component {/*rendering-the-root-component*/}

To call `render`, you need a piece of JSX and a DOM container:

<APIAnatomy>

<AnatomyStep title="React element">

The UI you want to render.

</AnatomyStep>

<AnatomyStep title="DOM container">

The DOM node you want to render your UI into. The container itself isn’t modified, only its children are.

</AnatomyStep>

```js [[1, 2, "<App />"], [2, 2, "container"]]
const container = document.getElementById('root');
render(<App />, container);
```

</APIAnatomy>

In apps fully built with React, you will do this once at the top level of your app--to render the "root" component.

<Sandpack>

```js index.js active
import './styles.css';
import {render} from 'react-dom';
import App from './App.js';

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

```js App.js
export default function App() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}
```

</Sandpack>

---

### Rendering multiple roots {/*rendering-multiple-roots*/}

If you use ["sprinkles"](/learn/add-react-to-a-website) of React here and there, call `render` for each top-level piece of UI managed by React.

<Sandpack>

```html public/index.html
<nav id="navigation"></nav>
<main>
  <p>This paragraph is not rendered by React (open index.html to verify).</p>
  <section id="comments"></section>
</main>
```

```js index.js active
import './styles.css';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { Comments, Navigation } from './Components.js';

render(
  <Navigation />,
  document.getElementById('navigation')
);

render(
  <Comments />,
  document.getElementById('comments')
);
```

```js Components.js
export function Navigation() {
  return (
    <ul>
      <NavLink href="/">Home</NavLink>
      <NavLink href="/about">About</NavLink>
    </ul>
  );
}

function NavLink({ href, children }) {
  return (
    <li>
      <a href={href}>{children}</a>
    </li>
  );
}

export function Comments() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Comments</h2>
      <Comment text="Hello!" author="Sophie" />
      <Comment text="How are you?" author="Sunil" />
    </>
  );
}

function Comment({ text, author }) {
  return (
    <p>{text} — <i>{author}</i></p>
  );
}
```

```css
nav ul { padding: 0; margin: 0; }
nav ul li { display: inline-block; margin-right: 20px; }
```

</Sandpack>

### Updating the rendered tree {/*updating-the-rendered-tree*/}

You can call `render` more than once on the same DOM node. As long as the component tree structure matches up with what was previously rendered, React will [preserve the state](/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state). Notice how you can type in the input:

<Sandpack>

```js index.js active
import {render} from 'react-dom';
import App from './App.js';

let i = 0;
setInterval(() => {
  render(
    <App counter={i} />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
  i++;
}, 1000);
```

```js App.js
export default function App({counter}) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello, world! {counter}</h1>
      <input placeholder="Type something here" />
    </>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

You can destroy the rendered tree with [`unmountComponentAtNode()`](TODO).
