#### Props {/*props*/}

These special React props are supported for all built-in components:

* `children`: A React node (an element, a string, a number, [a portal,](/apis/react-dom/createPortal) an empty node like `null`, `undefined` and booleans, or an array of other React nodes). Specifies the content inside the component. When you use JSX, you will usually specify the `children` prop implicitly by nesting tags like `<div><span /></div>`.

* `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`: An object of the form `{ __html: '<p>some html</p>' }` with a raw HTML string inside. Overrides the [`innerHTML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML) property of the DOM node and displays the passed HTML inside. This should be used with extreme caution! If the HTML inside isn't trusted (for example, if it's based on user data), you risk introducing an [XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) vulnerability. [Read more about using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.](#rendering-raw-html-inside-a-tag)

* `ref`: A ref object from [`useRef`](/apis/react/useRef) or [`createRef`](/apis/react/createRef), or a [`ref` callback function,](#ref-callback-function) or a string for [legacy refs.](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#legacy-api-string-refs) Your ref will be filled with the DOM element for this node. [Read more about manipulating the DOM with refs.](/learn/manipulating-the-dom-with-refs)

* `suppressContentEditableWarning`: A boolean. If `true`, suppresses the warning that React shows for elements that both have `children` and `contentEditable={true}` (which normally do not work together). Use this if you're building a text input library that manages the `contentEditable` content manually.

* `suppressHydrationWarning`: A boolean. If you use [server rendering,](/apis/react-dom/server) normally there is a warning when the server and the client render different content. In some rare cases (like timestamps), it is very hard or impossible to guarantee an exact match. If you set `suppressHydrationWarning` to `true`, React will not warn you about mismatches in the attributes and the content of that element. It only works one level deep, and is intended to be used as an escape hatch. Don't overuse it. [Read more about suppressing hydration errors.](/apis/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#suppressing-unavoidable-hydration-mismatch-errors)

* `style`: An object with CSS styles, for example `{ fontWeight: 'bold', margin: 20 }`. Similarly to the DOM [`style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style) property, the CSS property names need to be written as `camelCase`, for example `fontWeight` instead of `font-weight`. You can pass strings or numbers as values. If you pass a number, like `width: 100`, React will automatically append `px` ("pixels") to the value unless it's a [unitless property.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/81d4ee9ca5c405dce62f64e61506b8e155f38d8d/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/shared/CSSProperty.js#L8-L57) We recommend using `style` only for dynamic styles where you don't know the style values ahead of time. In other cases, applying plain CSS classes with `className` is more efficient. [Read more about applying CSS with `className` and `styles`.](#applying-css-styles)

These standard DOM props are also supported for all built-in components:

* [`accessKey`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/accesskey): A string. Specifies a keyboard shortcut for the element. [Not generally recommended.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/accesskey#accessibility_concerns)
* [`aria-*`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes): ARIA attributes let you specify the accessibility tree information for this element. See [ARIA attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes) for a complete reference. In React, all ARIA attribute names are exactly the same as in HTML.
* [`autoCapitalize`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autocapitalize): A string. Specifies whether and how the user input should be capitalized.
* [`className`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className): A string. Specifies the element's CSS class name. Same as [`class` attribute in HTML.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class) React uses the standard DOM property names (`className`) instead of HTML attribute names.
* [`contentEditable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable): A boolean. If `true`, the browser lets the user edit the rendered element directly. This is used to implement rich text input libraries like [Lexical.](https://lexical.dev/) React warns if you try to pass React children to an element with `contentEditable={true}` because React will not be able to update its content after user edits.
* [`data-*`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*): Data attributes let you attach some string data to the element, for example `data-fruit="banana"`. In React, they are not commonly used because you would usually read data from props or state instead.
* [`dir`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/dir): Either `'ltr'` or `'rtl'`. Specifies the text direction of the element.
* [`draggable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/draggable): A boolean. Specifies whether the element is draggable. Part of [HTML Drag and Drop API.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API)
* [`enterKeyHint`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/enterKeyHint): A string. Specifies which action to present for the enter key on virtual keyboards.
* [`htmlFor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLLabelElement/htmlFor): A string. For [`<label>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) and [`<output>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/output), lets you [associate the label with some control.](/apis/react-dom/components/input#providing-a-label-for-an-input) Same as [`for` HTML attribute.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/for) React uses the standard DOM property names (`htmlFor`) instead of HTML attribute names.
* [`hidden`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/hidden): A boolean or a string. Specifies whether the element should be hidden.
* [`id`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id): A string. Specifies a unique identifier for this element, which can be used to find it later or connect it with other elements. Generate it with [`useId`](/apis/react/useId) to avoid clashes between multiple instances of the same component.
* [`inputMode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inputmode): A string. Specifies what kind of keyboard to display (for example, text, number or telephone).
* [`itemProp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/itemprop): A string. Specifies which property the element represents for structured data crawlers.
* [`lang`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang): A string. Specifies the language of the element.
* [`role`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles): A string. Specifies the element role explicitly for assistive technologies.
nt.
* [`slot`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles): A string. Specifies the slot name when using shadow DOM. In React, an equivalent pattern is typically achieved by passing JSX as props, for example `<Layout left={<Sidebar />} right={<Content />} />`.
* [`spellCheck`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/spellcheck): A boolean or null. If explicitly set to `true` or `false`, enables or disables spellchecking.
* [`tabIndex`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex): A number. Overrides the default Tab button behavior. [Avoid using values other than `-1` and `0`.](https://www.tpgi.com/using-the-tabindex-attribute/)
* [`title`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title): A string. Specifies the tooltip text for the element.
* [`translate`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/translate): Either `'yes'` or `'no'`. Passing `'no'` excludes the element content from being translated.

You can also pass custom attributes as props, for example `mycustomprop="someValue".` This can be useful when integrating with third-party libraries. The custom attribute name must be lowercase and must not start with `on`. The value will be converted to a string. If you pass `null` or `undefined`, the custom attribute will be removed.



#### Caveats {/*caveats*/}

- You cannot pass both `children` and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` at the same time.
