<Intro>

React development is led by a small dedicated team working full time at Facebook. It also receives contributions from people all over the world.

</Intro>

## React Core {/*react-core*/}

The React Core team members work full time on the core component APIs, the engine that powers React DOM and React Native, React DevTools, and the React documentation website.

Current members of the React team are listed in alphabetical order below.

In between that time Josh has been an IC, Manager, and Executive at a few startups. outside of work he likes to push his limits with cooking.

### Lauren Tan {/*lauren-tan*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/lauren.jpg" github="poteto" twitter="potetotes" personal="no.lol">
    Lauren’s programming career peaked when she first discovered the `<marquee>` tag. She’s been chasing that high ever since. When she’s not adding bugs into React, she enjoys dropping cheeky memes in chat, and playing all too many video games with her partner and dog Zelda.
</TeamMember>

### Luna Ruan {/*luna-ruan*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/lunaruan.jpg" github="lunaruan" twitter="lunaruan">
    Luna learned programming because she thought it meant creating video games. Instead, she ended up working on the Pinterest web app, and now on React itself. Luna doesn't want to make video games anymore, but she plans to do creative writing if she ever gets bored.

### Rick Hanlon {/*rick-hanlon*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/rickhanlonii.jpg" github="rickhanlonii" twitter="rickhanlonii" personal="rickhanlon.codes">
    Ricky majored in theoretical math and somehow found himself on the React Native team for a couple years before joining the React team. When he's not programming you can find him snowboarding, biking, climbing, golfing, or closing GitHub issues that do not match the issue template.
</TeamMember>

### Samuel Susla {/*samuel-susla*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/sam.jpeg" github="sammy-SC" twitter="SamuelSusla">
    Samuel’s interest in programming started with the movie Matrix. He still has Matrix screen saver. Before working on React, he was focused on writing iOS apps. Outside of work, Samuel enjoys playing beach volleyball, squash, badminton and spending time with his family.

### Sathya Gunasekaran {/*sathya-gunasekaran*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/sathya.jpg" github="gsathya" twitter="_gsathya">

</TeamMember>

### Sebastian Markbåge {/*sebastian-markbåge*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/sebmarkbage.jpg" github="sebmarkbage" twitter="sebmarkbage">
    Sebastian majored in psychology. He's usually quiet. Even when he says something, it often doesn't make sense to the rest of us until a few months later. The correct way to pronounce his surname is "mark-boa-geh" but he settled for "mark-beige" out of pragmatism -- and that's how he approaches React.
</TeamMember>

### Sebastian Silbermann {/*sebastian-silbermann*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/sebsilbermann.jpg" github="eps1lon" twitter="sebsilbermann">
    Sebastian learned programming to make the browser games he played during class more enjoyable. Eventually this lead to contributing to as much open source code as possible. Outside of coding he's busy making sure people don't confuse him with the other Sebastians and Zilberman of the React community.

### Tianyu Yao {/*tianyu-yao*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/tianyu.jpg" github="tyao1" twitter="tianyu0">
    Tianyu’s interest in computers started as a kid because he loves video games. So he majored in computer science and still plays childish games like League of Legends. When he is not in front of a computer, he enjoys playing with his two kittens, hiking and kayaking.
