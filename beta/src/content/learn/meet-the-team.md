<Intro>

React development is led by a small dedicated team working full time at Facebook. It also receives contributions from people all over the world.

</Intro>

## React Core {/*react-core*/}

The React Core team members work full time on the core component APIs, the engine that powers React DOM and React Native, React DevTools, and the React documentation website.

Current members of the React team are listed in alphabetical order below.

### Andrew Clark {/*andrew-clark*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/acdlite.jpg" github="acdlite" twitter="acdlite">
    Andrew got started with web development by making sites with WordPress, and eventually tricked himself into doing JavaScript. His favorite pastime is karaoke. Andrew is either a Disney villain or a Disney princess, depending on the day.
</TeamMember>

### Dan Abramov {/*dan-abramov*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/gaearon.jpg" github="gaearon" twitter="dan_abramov">
    Dan got into programming after he accidentally discovered Visual Basic inside Microsoft PowerPoint. He has found his true calling in turning [Sebastian](#sebastian-markbåge)'s tweets into long-form blog posts. Dan occasionally wins at Fortnite by hiding in a bush until the game ends.
</TeamMember>

### Lauren Tan {/*lauren-tan*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/lauren.jpg" github="poteto" twitter="potetotes" personal="no.lol">
    Lauren’s programming career peaked when she first discovered the `<marquee>` tag. She’s been chasing that high ever since. When she’s not adding bugs into React, she enjoys dropping cheeky memes in chat, and playing all too many video games with her partner and dog Zelda.
</TeamMember>

### Luna Ruan {/*luna-ruan*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/lunaruan.jpg" github="lunaruan" twitter="lunaruan">
    Luna learned programming because she thought it meant creating video games. Instead, she ended up working on the Pinterest web app, and now on React itself. Luna doesn't want to make video games anymore, but she plans to do creative writing if she ever gets bored.
</TeamMember>

### Rick Hanlon {/*rick-hanlon*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/rickhanlonii.jpg" github="rickhanlonii" twitter="rickhanlonii" personal="rickhanlon.codes">
    Ricky majored in theoretical math and somehow found himself on the React Native team for a couple years before joining the React team. When he's not programming you can find him snowboarding, biking, climbing, golfing, or closing GitHub issues that do not match the issue template.
</TeamMember>

### Sebastian Markbåge {/*sebastian-markbåge*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/sebmarkbage.jpg" github="sebmarkbage" twitter="sebmarkbage">
    Sebastian majored in psychology. He's usually quiet. Even when he says something, it often doesn't make sense to the rest of us until a few months later. The correct way to pronounce his surname is "mark-boa-geh" but he settled for "mark-beige" out of pragmatism -- and that's how he approaches React.
