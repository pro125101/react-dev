Writing tests for React components ensures that its behaviour matches your expectations and requirements. Tests can guarantee that components' behaviour don't break in the future, even as you keep iterating and making changes to it. They are also useful as readable specifications for learning about your components, and how they interact with each other.

- [_Recipes_](/docs/testing-recipes.html): Common patterns when writing tests for React Components.
- [_Environments_](/docs/testing-environments.html): Setting up your testing environment can affect how tests are written, and how they run.
- [_act()_](/docs/act.html): React's `act()` test helper is useful for predictable behaviour in test environments.
